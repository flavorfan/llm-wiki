My name is David Andre and this is the
clearest explanation of auto research
you're going to find on the internet.
So, what is auto research? It's an open
source project by Andre Karpathy that
lets AI improve itself autonomously. You
have an AI agent that runs experiments
automatically and it keeps what works
and throws away everything that doesn't.
So, in this video, I'm going to explain
how auto research actually works, how
you can use it in your own life and
business because there are a lot of
implications, and how you can build your
very first auto research loop. So, if
you really want to be on the cutting
edge of AI, make sure to watch until the
end. First off, who is Andre Karpathy?
He's one of the most legendary AI
researchers of all time. He's one of the
OpenAI co-founders and he is the main
person behind Tesla Autopilot. Oh, yeah,
and he's also the guy who invented the
term vibe coding. Plus, he has
contributed a lot to the open source
community, especially in AI. And yes,
most importantly, he was born in
Czechoslovakia. However, this video is
about one of his contributions and that
is auto research. Karpathy had a
training script for the GPT-2 model that
he's been optimizing for many months.
And then he realized, "Why am I doing
this? Why don't I just have an AI agent
run different experiments in a loop to
figure out what's the best way to
optimize this model?" And this is the
core idea. Give AI one file, one metric,
and let it run hundreds, if not
thousands, of experiments by itself
while you sleep and watch it improve.
And yes, at the end of the video, I'll
show you how you can build your first
auto research loop. And yes, you can do
this even if you're a complete beginner.
Now, let's talk about the prepare.py
file because it's essential to
understand this. The agent cannot touch
prepare.py so that it can't cheat the
eval you set for it. Without this
limitation, it could rewrite the scoring
function to fake its results. So,
basically, the prepare.py file defines
what better means. Now, of course, if
you set the wrong metric, you'll get the
wrong results. So, here is a nice
graphic that visualizes the loop. First,
the agent comes up with a hypothesis,
right? A theory of what it could
improve, what experiment it could run.
Then it modifies the code, you train it
for around 5 minutes, then it runs the
evaluation to see if it's good or if
it's not good. If it wants to keep it,
it will just commit it to your Git
history. If it's bad and if it worsens
the results, it will do Git reset and
repeat the whole loop over and over and
over as many times as you want, you
know,
&gt;&gt; [laughter]
&gt;&gt; depending on how many dollars you want
to spend or tokens. And yeah, this is
auto research basically in a single
image. So, if you start it right before
going to bed, it can run roughly 100
experiments overnight. Now, by giving it
a fixed time budget, you make every
experiment directly comparable because
let's say you're hiring for your
company. If you have one applicant and
you give him 7 days to complete the task
and the other one only has 7 minutes,
then obviously the one who has 7 days,
on average, will do better. So, you want
to make sure this is the same in AI
agents. That way the agent can't cheat
just by training longer or by training
better ideas. Only the raw idea wins
with the same time allocated. But if you
think that auto research only applies to
the training of AI models, you are badly
mistaken. This has massive implications
across every domain of your life or
business. You can build a recursive
self-improving loop for nearly anything
that can be measured. Thanks to AI
agents, soon enough, the execution of
any work or task will become basically
free. However, what will become valuable
is knowing what to measure, picking the
right metric, and setting the right
constraints. This is the skill that is
going to make millionaires in the
future. And by the way, this is the
clearest example of what AI agents
actually look like in practice. Not just
chatbots, but real autonomous loops that
do meaningful work for companies or
individuals. And if you reason about the
state of AI from first principles, you
realize that this has been the end goal
all along. Andre Karpathy predicts that
all LLM frontier labs will do this. They
will run some sort of auto research.
This is the final boss battle. And if
you think about it, this is literally
what recursive [clears throat]
self-improvement will look like. And the
funny thing is that right now, the AI
labs like OpenAI and Anthropic Gemini
are spending tens of millions of dollars
on researchers, all of which are trying
to build this. Yet, Karpathy made it
completely open source. Now, to
understand auto research, you must
understand its three-file architecture.
First, you have program.md. This is the
most important file. This is the human
setting the goal, the constraints, and
the rules for the agent. Then you have
the train.py file. This is the one file
that the agent can actually change. And
this could be anything, by the way.
Code, some config, a prompt, some math
equation, literally anything you want to
optimize. And then you have prepare.py.
This is the metric and the evaluation
script. The agent cannot touch this.
Absolutely never. Because this is what
measures the result. And by the way,
there are several tech billionaires who
are going crazy over this, such as the
CEO of Shopify and the CEO of Stripe,
because these guys realized that this is
not just about training AI models. And
this perhaps the biggest misconception
about auto research. People think that
it's just about optimizing of machine
learning, right? Because this is what
Karpathy used as the example. But if you
actually pay attention and if you think
about it a little bit more, you realize
that as long as you have a clear metric
and you can run these experiments, this
could be used in so many different ways.
In marketing, in business, in testing
new products, in trading strategies, in
personal life, in weather forecast,
literally hundreds of possible domains.
You can build these auto research loops
that don't have any human in the loop,
but instead swarm of AI agents running
experiments, discarding what doesn't
work and keeping what works. And as
Karpathy says here, we might be in the
early stages of the singularity. Now,
every AI workflow has the same
bottleneck, getting fresh real-world
data. You can build the most
sophisticated AI agent, but if it can't
see what's actually on the web right
now, it's flying blind. That's where
Oxylabs comes in. The Oxylabs web
scraper API lets you pull structured
data from basically any website. This
could be Amazon product listings, Google
search results, real estate listings,
all through a single API call. It
handles proxy rotation, captcha solving,
and JavaScript rendering so you don't
have to do that yourself. But here is
what makes it interesting for us AI
developers. Oxylabs has an official MCP
that you can connect directly to Cursor
or Cloud Code in a matter of a minute so
that your AI agent gets live web
scraping superpowers. Say you need to
pull competitor's pricing or scrape
search results or grab real estate
listings. Just ask it in plain English.
The agent calls Oxylabs, gets structured
data back, and reasons over it. And even
if you aren't a developer, Oxylabs plugs
straight into N8N. You can visually
build a workflow that scrapes Amazon
prices, sends them to an AI, and spits
out insights with zero code written by
you. And the best part is, Oxylabs gives
up to 2,000 scrape results for free so
you can test it yourself. So, go to
oxylabs.io/david
for the free trial. Oh, and there is no
credit card required. And if you run out
of credits, use my code david for 20%
off all Oxylabs plans. And thank you to
Oxylabs for sponsoring this video.
Again, I need to stress, auto research
is not just for machine learning. This
pattern works anywhere you can measure
an outcome, a clear outcome. And
Karpathy said this himself, "Any metric
you care about that is reasonably
efficient to evaluate can be auto
researched." So, you need one file to
edit, one scalar metric, and a time box
loop. If you can score it, you can auto
research it. Now, let's look at some
practical valuable use cases. First off,
trading. You can take the same auto
research loop, but instead of improving
an AI model, you can point it on a
trading strategy. The agent tweaks your
buy/sell rules, tries experiments based
on years of market data, and scores each
experiment by its sharp ratio, which is
basically how good are the returns to
the risk. And it can test hundreds of
different trading strategies to see
which one has the best returns. Here is
another use case, marketing. You can now
apply auto research to marketing with
emails, ad creatives, landing pages,
automated AB tests, headlines,
thumbnails, YouTube titles, any type of
marketing. Eric Seu put it the best,
"Most marketing teams run 30 experiments
per year. The next generation will run
36,000,
aka roughly 100 per day. The agent will
modify the copy and measure the
conversions and decide whether to keep
this experiment or to discard it." The
exact same loop as before. Now, before I
show you more use cases how auto
research can benefit your life, please
consider subscribing. 25% of you are
subscribed, which means the vast
majority of you watching right now are
not subscribed. So, if you want to see
more high-quality

2 seconds, go below the video, and click
the subscribe button. It helps out more
than you think. So, to all of you who
just subscribed, thank you. The next use
case is for developers. You can point
auto research at basically any code base
and say, "Make it faster." And people
are also using auto research to
fine-tune open source AI models so they
run faster locally on your laptop or
phone. So, expect in the next 6 months
insane breakthroughs in terms of what is
possible to run on phone. I would even
say that we will have Sonnet 4.6 quality
models runnable on iPhones in three or
four months. This is a prediction. Let's
see if it's correct. Another use case is
prompt engineering. Auto research can
fine-tune the system instructions behind
all of your AI agents. So, Harrison
Chase, the founder of LangChain, which
is a billion-dollar company, said,
"Agents mess up because they don't have
the right context." And system prompts
are part of that context. So, auto
research can find new ways to phrase
things. Better language, maybe even
different language, you know? Maybe
instead of English, it can use Polish or
Czech or German, whatever. It can try
different levels, like beginner, you
know, college level, PhD level, to see
which prompt works the best for all of
your AI agents. So, these are the three
conditions that decide whether your auto
research loop will be successful or will
be a failure. Number one, a clear
metric. One number, a clear direction
you want to go in. And number two, an
automated evaluation where there isn't a
human in the loop, right? If you, the
human, need to be in the loop, it will
be so slow, and it will be not be auto
research. Sure, it still can be
research, but it will not be auto
research. It will not be running while
you sleep. And number three, there is
one file that the agent can change. Not
two, not zero, one file. And you need
all of these three conditions for auto
research to work. Now, here's where auto
research will fail. Brand design, UX,
pricing, anything where better is
subjective. Now, for example, in
pricing, you could have it succeed if
you have a large volume of traffic to
your pricing page, and you can quickly
AB test different pricing to see highest
cash collected, but for most businesses,
it will not be effective, right? Because
the quality of that makes better is
subjective, or the loop is too slow. The
loop needs objective metric. If the
success is a judgment call or a feeling,
the agent cannot tell what's working.
So, it will optimize in a random
direction. Also, I want to stress this
again. If you give it a bad metric, it
will very confidently optimize the wrong
thing. So, here is Andrej Karpathy's end
vision. In the early 2000s, there was a
project SETI@home that let anyone donate
their spare computer power to research
for alien life. And Andrej Karpathy
wants to do the same model, the same
idea, but for AI research, where you
have millions of AI agents distributed
across thousands of computers, and you
can actually allocate where that
research goes towards. All right, so
now, let me show you how to actually
build your own auto research loop from
scratch, even if you're a complete
beginner. Just stick with me for the
next 5 minutes, and you'll be ahead of
99.9% of people in AI who just pay
ChatGPT subscription and they think
they're advanced. They cannot even dream
about having their own auto research,
but you are like a couple of steps away
from having that. So, lock in. So, first
of all, this is the GitHub repo. I'm
going to link it below the video. This
is the auto research repository from
Karpathy. I'm going to star it as well,
cuz it's a great project. Now, if you
are not familiar with GitHub, you don't
need to panic. You don't need to
understand much. It's just a way to
store code, okay? Efficient way to store
coding projects. That's all you need to
understand. You don't need to be a Git
expert, nothing like that. All we need
to do is click here on the code, and
click copy here. That's it. Next, you
need an IDE. So, either VS Code or
Cursor. I'm going to be using Cursor
here. Just install an IDE of some sort,
and we're going to use the coding agent.
I'm going to use Claude Code. So, I'm
going to open an empty project here.
Boom. Nothing in here. You can see on
the right, no files. And I'm going to
launch Claude. Dangerously skip
permissions. Boom. Enter. So, here it
is, Claude Code. Now, I'm going to say,
create a new folder {slash} original in
our repo root level, and in there, clone
this GitHub repository. Boom. Paste it
in. And again, Claude Code will know
what to do exactly. So, it will figure
out, okay, everything is empty, and then
it created original folder and cloned it
in there. Now, why did I want to do it?
Well, because I want to create a
separate folder where we're going to
build something with auto research for
us, but I also want to keep the original
repository here, so that we can use it
as a reference. Next, I'm going to say,
now create {slash} website folder root
level, and in there, build the following
project. XML text. Boom. Project. So, I
have described a clear vision for a
simple web app. And what I'm going to
show you is how you can use auto
research to optimize any website you
have, right? Whether it's a personal
website, whether it's your AI startup,
any type of website to optimize the
loading times or anything else that you
can measure, but loading times loading
times are very easy to measure, so
they're a great candidate for an auto
research loop. So, I'm just having
Claude Code with bypass all permissions
build this, so that we can
build our own auto research loop. And in
fact, while this is running, let me
launch a Codex in Yolo mode. Boom. We
put it here. So, I'm going to rename it,
so it's clear for you guys what it's
what. Codex CLI. GPT-4.6 is actually
really good at
fixing and debugging, but Claude Code
with Opus 4.6 is really incredible to
work with, especially with fast mode. I
know it costs a lot of money if you do
{slash} fast, but I highly recommend it,
and I also highly recommend it inside of
Codex. And keep it on high. Extra high
is usually overkill. So, for Codex, I'm
going to say, create a benchmark.mjs
file inside of {slash} original folder
where it makes sense. We're going to
give it the eval instructions. Hit hand
hit enter. Okay, actually, first I'm
going to say, read the structure of the
Actually, that's my bad. It should be in
the website here. Website folder, not
original, because it should read the
original It shows the original repo by
Karpathy to understand where the eval
script should be. Boom. So, this is
going to use Puppeteer to test the speed
locally of this website.
Um
it we should have the project running on
localhost 3000. Let me see. So,
basically, I asked it to create a simple
portfolio website with Express and
static files. So, let's see what it
built. Here's what it looks like. Alex
Morgan. Uh just a simple portfolio
website. Like, you could see this is
literally like 10, 15 years ago, every
website looked like that, right?
Everybody who like is new to HTML and
CSS would have stuff like this in high
school and think they're the best
website designer. I'm guilty of that as
well. But anyways, let's
see whether Codex finished this. Okay,
it did. So, we have the setup. So, now
let's understand the repo, right?
Remember, there are the three main
files. program.md, train.py, and
prepare.py. So, the original program.md
looks like this from Karpathy, and he
wrote this himself. And this is a very
useful instruction, by the way. Feel
free to steal this prompt into many of
your agentic projects where you want the
agent to keep going forever, or as close
to forever as possible. But we need to
kind of write our own. Okay, so let's go
back into Claude Code, and I'm going to
tell it what to do. To CD into the
website folder, and to install
Puppeteer, and run this baseline script.
We're going to [clears throat] benchmark
our website of our expert Alex Morgan
portfolio designer to see how fast or
slow this is, and then we're going to
run auto research to optimize the living
out of it, okay? Okay, let's see. Okay,
we have the results. So, Puppeteer ran,
and it closed the Chrome faster than I
could see it, or it ran in the
background, but basically, we have the
medium load time, 50 ms,
which is
not that bad. So, we'll see whether auto
research can can optimize this. Okay, so
now, the most important part of any auto
research loop is the program.md. So, I'm
going to go into our website folder,
create a new file, program.md, and this
is the main file.
And actually, we can use inspiration
from Karpathy to say like, so read the
program.md inside of {slash} original,
and then build our new {slash} website
{slash} program.md file on top of that,
but relevant to our website speed
benchmarking auto research objective.
Okay? So, we're going to borrow Andrej
Karpathy's from engineering that he
optimized quite heavily for his own
project, and we're going to have Claude
Code rewrite that into our own
program.md, which is going to be
relevant to our own project. So, again,
feel free to steal this for whatever you
want. Any business use case, any
marketing use case, any make money use
case, anything where there's a clear
metric, you can create your own
program.md, and boom, just like that, I
used Claude Code to write 128 lines of
instructions and to adapt it to this
project. So, now, the program.md is
highly relevant to this specific
project. Okay, so I'm going to say, do
this next. Give it clear instruction of
what I want Claude Code to do. To
stage this, commit this as a baseline.
So, remember, if an experiment is
successful, it commits the result into
history.that tweak. If it's not, it does
get reset and try something else. Now,
I'm going to say, read program.md, run
baseline benchmark first, record
results.tsv,
then begin the experiment loop. Do not
stop or ask me anything. Just keep
running experiments automatically. And
there we go. We have our first auto
research loop running. Maybe I could
have created a separate agent in a
separate Claude Code or Codex. And
obviously, you can try different agents
and see which, you know, which one
performs the best. But
as you can see, it's not So, look,
slightly worse looks like noise. Let me
rerun to confirm. Still worse. Following
protocol, revert. Okay, amazing. So, it
ran an experiment, and the speed of the
website was worse. So, it's going to try
something else. And this is the whole
point of auto research. I'm not doing
anything. My hands are up. And even if I
was doing this, first of all, I would
need to be a solid front-end developer.
And second of all, I couldn't do it so
quickly, right? So, even if you are a
great front-end developer and you know
how to optimize websites, you're still
Okay, now it found an improvement.
You're still not going to beat an AI
agent that can generate hundreds of
tokens per second. So, it found an
improvement. Look at this. 33
milliseconds instead of 50. So, it's
already down 34% in a matter of less
than a minute. This is the power of auto
research. Okay, and look at this.
Another one. 28 milliseconds. Another
15% improvement in a matter of two or
three minutes, guys. Yeah, auto research
is insane, and I have a feeling that
this is not the last video I'm going to
make on auto research. So again, if you
want me to make more content on auto
research, make sure to subscribe. And if
you are someone who's building his own
AI startup, you want to build a real AI
business, then listen up, because in my
accelerator, we work closely with a
handful of founders for 6 months to help
them scale aggressively. And in fact,
for the rest of March, we are offering
free idea validation calls. So, if you
have an AI app you want to build, and
you want to turn it into a real
profitable business, then make sure to
click the second link in the
description, which will take you to the
landing page to see if you qualify for a
free idea validation call. But again,
this is only for serious founders who
actually want to build a real AI
business. That being said, thank you
guys for watching. I'm going to let this
auto research loop run for a bit. We're
already on a 25 milliseconds. That's
crazy. Already half in a matter of 4
minutes. Let's see where this gets, and
yeah, I'm going to update you on
Twitter. So, make sure to follow me on
Twitter, and have a great productive
week.
